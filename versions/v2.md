## Alterations
- Add a tool bar to allow for easy access to the grid settings
    - on phones and tablets, when in a portrait mode, or when the canvas is taller than it is wide, the tool bar is at the bottom of the screen
    - on phones and tablets, when in a landscape mode, or when the canvas is wider than it is tall, the tool bar is at the right of the screen
    - on desktops, the tool bar is at the right side of the screen
- The grid can be scaled immediately by pinch-zooming on touchscreen devices or using the mouse wheel on desktops
- The grid can be moved immediately by dragging on touchscreen devices or using the mouse on desktops
- The grid can be rotated immediately by pinching twisting on touchscreen devices or using the right click dragging on desktops
    - right click dragging functions as positioning a pivot point for the rotation at the point of click and then calculating the rotation as a line from the pivot point to the current point, fixed at the point of release.  This line represents the horizontal axis of the grid, where this is 90 degrees top vertical
