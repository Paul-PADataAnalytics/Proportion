# v3 Release Notes

## Overview
This major update focuses on interface simplification, performance optimization on the Web, and enhanced export reliability.

## Improvements

### Grid Modes
There are now 4 distinct, persistent modes for the grid. Switching between modes preserves your settings for each.

1. **Square**
    - Controls: Cell Size
    - Features: Subdivision support
2. **Square (Fixed)** *Default Mode*
    - Controls: Column Count (Rows are auto-calculated)
    - Default: 6 columns
    - Features: Subdivision support
3. **Rectangle**
    - Controls: Width, Height
    - Features: Subdivision support
4. **Rectangle (Fixed)**
    - Controls: Column Count, Row Count
    - Features: Subdivision support
5. **Circle**
    - Controls: Radius, Segments
    - Features: Subdivision support

### Interface & Experience
- **Simplified Controls**: All numeric inputs support direct typing and have a dedicated reset button.
- **Removed Complexity**: Rotation gesture and controls have been removed to prevent accidental misalignment.
- **Export Feedback**: Added a clear "Please wait, exporting..." dialog to communicate progress during heavy processing phases.
- **Visuals**: Grid lines are anti-aliased in high-quality exports (JPG/PNG).

### Performance (Web)
- **Background Processing**: Image encoding is now offloaded to background workers (using `compute`), preventing the UI from freezing completely during large exports.
- **Optimization**: Switched to a standard `Uint8List` transfer method for reliable performance across all web browsers.

### Export Formats
- **PNG**: High fidelity, lossless.
- **JPG**: Optimized for smaller file sizes (Quality: 90).
- **PDF**: Generates a standard PDF document with the gridded image.

## Change Log
1. **Refactored UI**: Split GridSettings into distinct `GridConfig` subclasses for better state management.
2. **Web Crash Fix**: Removed incompatible `dart:isolate` usage (`TransferableTypedData`) in favor of standard `compute` calls.
3. **Export UX**: Replaced the freezing spinner with a static "Please wait" dialog for better user transparency on single-threaded environments.
4. **Disabled Rotation**: Removed rotation logic from `GridGestureDetector` and `ToolbarWidget`.
5. **PDF Support**: Added `pdf` package dependency and implementation.
